The RTX_Blinky project is a simple RTX Kernel based example
for the NXP 'LPC1768' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' 
Evaluation Board, compliant to Cortex Microcontroller 
Software Interface Standard (CMSIS V2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =  12 MHz
   - PLL0  = 400 MHz
   - CCLK  = 100 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor driver.
2 LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC1768 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC1768 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (may be used for target debugging)
